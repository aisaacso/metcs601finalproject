An internationally certified referee and a Group A member of both the US Olympic Committee and Pan-American Games, he also hosts his annual Rhode Island Open tournament. After arriving in the United States in 1982, Grand Master Hong opened his first school, focusing his teachings on both traditional and Olympic styles. The following year, he founded the Taekwondo Club of Brown University, which he also taught for the next twenty years. In 1993, he opened another school, continuing to teach students the vast benefits of Taekwondo. The accolates that Grand Master Hong has received are not only numerous, but also very well deserved. He has been awarded as one of the top ten grand masters in in the United States. His teachings have given rise to over one thousand black belts, some of whom have gone on to become masters or instructors, teaching students in the ways that they had first learned. Grand Master Hong's philosophy is that Taekwondo is much more than self-defense. He teaches that its foundation is about mental discipline, confidence, balance, and harmony. Gaining strength and energy in these qualities will not only make one a good student, but also a better person in life.</div>
            <div id="jinbio" class="bio">A 4th Dan Master originally from Korea, Jin Yung Jin has been guiding students in their training for 20+ years, and has shown a great ability in focusing students to the finer points of the class curriculum. Teaching primarily family and adult classes, Master Jin finds that one of the most endearing qualities is to teach students not just have respect for others, but also to show the same amount of that respect in themselves and their abilities.</div>
